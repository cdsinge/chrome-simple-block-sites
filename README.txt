Made this expecting it only to be used personally.

Trivial (absolutely no-frills/features!) Chrome extension for blocking distracting sites.  I'm certain a better version on some repo exists elsewhere with many more features; I was purely interested to see how simple Chrome extensions are.

And w.r.t. using existing extensions generally, articles like  https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/07/snoopware-installed-by-11-million-ios-android-chrome-and-firefox-users/ worry me about giving my browsing history so easily,  and I doubt Chrome actually allows an extension to accomplish this without excessive permissions (Though given it's matching against a static list, it'd be possible to give no permissions at all to your browsing history, but no real incentive for Google to provide such functionality etc, unless it affected their reputation).

To add extension in developer mode, chrome://extensions, unpack directory.  Can also enable/disable here.

List of websites to disable in the options menu (right-click on extension in toolbar), anything listed (and their superstrings) will not be visitable (minor exemptions).
